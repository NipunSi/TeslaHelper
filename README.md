### TeslaPal

TeslaPal is a vehicle companion app made for Tesla owners. It allows users to see important information and data about their car as well as remotely send commands to it.

### How it works

The app uses the [Tesla API](https://tesla-api.timdorr.com/) through [TeslaSwift](https://github.com/jonasman/TeslaSwift) and a Tesla login to connect to a vehicle. From there, the app can get various information such as location, battery percentage, and more. It can also send commands to the vehicle to unlock the doors, change the temperature, etc.
